class RuleUnsafe:
    """ Hold the current and historical states of a game. Accept/reject new moves.

    Ensure that each stone that is played (put) respects the rules of Go.
    Compute the captured stones.
    Hold the history of moves, as well as the history of killed stones, to allow rewind/forward.

    The current implementation of this class is based on "buffers" that are reset before each new change (either put
    or remove stone). The main line of play is updated only when confirm(). A kind of in-house transaction mechanism.

    This class is not thread safe. Plus, its consistency is highly dependent on the good usage of self.confirm()

        listener:
            Is informed when stones have changed.
        stones: list(list)
            The stones that have been confirmed so far.
        deleted: list
            The history of the stones that have been killed so far. Used to put them back on rewind.
        history: list
            The sequence of moves that brought to the current state. Needed by in-sequence modification
            algorithm, to check conflicts with subsequent moves.
