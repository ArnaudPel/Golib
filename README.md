The aim of this software is to display and edit Smart Game Format files.

As of Dec. 2013, variations are not supported in a game. This may imply frustrating behavior of the interface, compared to already-in-place editors. Hopefully this situation will be forgotten soon. Below are the features currently available.

### Put a stone on the goban
- left-click to append a stone of the next color (forbidden when browsing previous moves)
- hold 'b' or 'w' and left-click to insert a move inside a sequence. all subsequent moves will have their number increased by 1.

### Remove a stone
- select a stone with left-click, and press `del`.

### Relocate a stone
- in order to ease manual correction of stone detection, stones can be dragged across the goban using the usual drag-and-drop interaction (hold left-button and move mouse)
